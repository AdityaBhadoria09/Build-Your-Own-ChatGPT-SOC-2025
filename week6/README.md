and then we will move on to milestone 4-  
**Milestone 4**  
 **Create a simple chatbot that uses the Gemini 2.0 API to respond to user inputs in a conversational way**. You don’t need to learn Node.js in depth — just generate the code using ChatGPT and focus on understanding the flow.
In GitHub upload node js folder (delete packages folder if it is too large) and gif/short video of your local host website in readme file.
